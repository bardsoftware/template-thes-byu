  \Title{Incredibly Useful Advice for Physics Students\\ Writing a Senior Thesis}

  \Advisor{Albert Einstein}

  \Abstract{The abstract is a \emph{summary} of the thesis,
  \emph{not an introduction}. Keep in mind that abstracts are
  often published separately from the paper they summarize. In
  your abstract, give a concise synopsis of the work,
  emphasizing the conclusions; you need not include the
  supporting arguments for the conclusions. The purpose of the
  abstract is to help prospective readers decide whether to
  read your thesis, but your goal is not necessarily to
  persuade people to read your thesis. A successful
  abstract enables people to get an accurate overall view of
  your work without needing to read it.

  Usually, an abstract contains only one paragraph, but it can
  have more if absolutely necessary. Remember to state the
  subject of the paper immediately followed by a summary of the
  experimental or theoretical results and the methods used to
  obtain them. Avoid equations, graphics, and citations; if a
  citation is essential it must be cited fully within the
  abstract. Keep the abstract factual. Avoid vague statements
  like, ``Conclusions are drawn," or ``the significance of the
  experiment is discussed."  State the conclusions and findings
  outright in the abstract.}
